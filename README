The simplest way to check if packages must be updated from Debian security repository

This script is designed to be executed as root in a jobcron.

Example:

# crontab -e
MAILTO="mysecurityemail@domain.tld"
0 1 * * * /bin/sh /my/security/path/scripts/check.sh


ToDo:
 - add an option to send the report by mail
